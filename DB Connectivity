migrations
steps

1 create the domain 
2 create the dbContext and inherit the DbContext
3 subscribe in the main project using the service collection 
4 nuget package, postgresql, and entity core framework are the necessary packages 


In simpler terms, DI helps manage dependencies (objects) outside of the class by passing them in via constructor, method, or property injection.

🔶 1. Reflection:- This is the main function of the reflection

🔧 1. Check the data type
🧠 2. Inspect all metadata of the type:
🧰 3. Create objects dynamically
🎯 4. Invoke methods dynamically
🔐 5. Access private members:-  🔐 1. What Does private Mean in C#?    
      In C#, private means:
      The member cannot be accessed directly outside of its class.
      Reflection bypasses compile-time checks. It uses runtime metadata to access members directly from the compiled assembly.
      It can access private members, but only if you explicitly allow it using binding flags:
      Yes, potentially.
      It can break encapsulation if misused.
      That's why it's not used in everyday coding.
      You typically use it only in tools, frameworks, and libraries—not in business logic.
          So yes, you can open the door with reflection, but you shouldn't unless you have a very good reason.
          FieldInfo field = typeof(MyClass).GetField("secret", 
          BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
                    It's a compile-time restriction, enforced by the C# compiler.
                    🔄 6. Use in Serialization / ORM / Frameworks
                    📦 7. Load external DLLs at runtime
