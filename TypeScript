This is the typescript tutorial

Static Checking in the typescript :- Static checking is primarily about reviewing and analyzing your code before it is compiled or run. Its main purpose is to catch potential errors and issues early in the development process, well before the code executes.
TypeScript parses your code into a structured form (AST).
t analyzes that structure without executing it to verify types and syntax.
Static checking in TypeScript:
Does not execute your code.
Analyzes the code by walking through its structure (AST)  Abstract Syntax Tree .
Checks for type correctness, syntax issues, and potential errors.
If no errors are found, the code is then transpiled (converted) into JavaScript.
The resulting JavaScript code can then be executed normally.

like the code const 
shape={width:10, h:12}
const num=10;
console.log(shape.width* shape.ht)  ****output in js is NaN
but in ts it will gives you the error.



The only difference between the js and ts is we have to declare the datatypes in typescript like  ########    let var_Name:type=value ############  

*type script can remmeber the data type if you did not provide the data type of any variable *

any :-using any keyword we can remove the typechecking of the typescript and can assign any value to this variable 
unknown:- this works same as any but it allow the type checking of the variables and it does not allow to assign the variables
access the properties or methods without the type checking
